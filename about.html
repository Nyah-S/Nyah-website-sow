    <p> I am Nyah Seymour, a Bahamian student currently attending St. Anne's School. </p>
    <p>I created this webpage to spread awareness to the fact that many schools (like mine) still don't allow students
      the liberty to wear certain protective hairstyles.</p>
    <p> My hope in creating this webpage is that people see it and realize this inconvenience towards young people of
      color.</p>
