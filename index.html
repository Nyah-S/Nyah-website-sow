  <h1> Why should schools encourage students to wear more black protective hairstyles? </h1>

  <p class="para1">
    Firstly, this kind of hairstyling is used by people of color not only for protecting their hair, but also because it
    reduces breakage and tangling. Wearing protective hairstyles can greatly affect a POC's (person on color) life, as
    it helps with getting and maintaining growth and is a huge time saver.
  </p>

  <p class="para2"> With this being said, </p>
  <h2> why exactly should schools allow more protective hairstyles? </h2>

  <ul>

    <li>Instead of spending hours in a hair salon each week to get a hairstyle that won't last, with protective
      hairstyles, students can focus more on school work and extracurricular activites.</li> <br>
    <li>Certain kinds of protective hairstyles that aren't typically allowed in schools can be worn for religious or
      cultural beliefs/purposes. Therefore, preventing students from embracing their culture can cause a huge disconnect
      with how they view themselves and the world.</li> <br>
    <li>If schools allow more protective hairstyles, this can help students both male and female express themselves
      more. </li> <br>
    <li>Protective hairstyling can, in many cases, be more cost efficient. In hindsight, getting your natural hair done
      every week for $50+ instead of spending $75+ to get braids that can last for 2-6 months is illogical, and overall
      more expensive</li> <br>
    <li>Overall students should be allowed to wear protective hairstyles, because in general it is better for their
      natural hair. As mentioned earlier, it helps with growth and reduces breakage and tangling, but above all, IT
      PROTECTS!</li>

  </ul>
